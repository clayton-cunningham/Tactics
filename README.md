# Scalable Strategy

Scalable Strategy is a game-like strategy system built from scratch that incorporates grid-based storage, efficient pathfinding algorithms, and a fluid sequencing loop. The application is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, enabling easy expansion and reuse of its components. It demonstrates the power of object-oriented design and algorithms in building scalable systems.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Grid-based Storage**: Stores and displays units, environment, and active states in a grid system, making it easy to manipulate and visualize data points based on grid coordinates.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient pathfinding in a grid, combining Queues and Hashmaps to maintain search priority.  This finds the shortest path between points on the grid, optimizing movement and interactions.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Designed with scalability in mind using object-oriented principles, making it easy to extend the system.
- **Dynamic Sequencing**: Includes a fluid sequencing loop for handling timed events or actions in the strategy system, allowing for smooth transitions and updates between game states or interactions.
- **Scalable Sizing**: Utilizes a centralized configuration for sprite sizes to allow for consistency between UI and controls, as well as easy changes to the design.
